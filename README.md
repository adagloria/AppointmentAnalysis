# AppointmentAnalysis
 Analyse Kaggle NoShow Appointment Data

## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.
Other packages used include Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using the Kaggle NoShow Appointments Dataset to understand if:
* there's a higher likelihood that men would show up for their appointment and the gender distribution of people who show up
* the day of the week for the appointment influence whether or not the patient shows up
* the type of illness play a major role in determining the target feature
* people who receive SMS reminders show up
* the time between the scheduled date and appointment date influence the target variable

## File Descriptions
The notebook shows work related to the above questions.
Markdown cells and inline comments were used to aid proper understanding of the individual steps.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here
